    This is a lame demo with no real flash client.  To
    see the demo in action, use the
    <a href="/demos/publisher.html">publisher application</a>
    ,
    and connect to the red5 application "/audiotranscoder"
    on this server.
    </p>
    <p>
    Then, start streaming a stream using 22,050 khz nellymoser
    audio.  Give it any name you want that does not start with
    "copy_".
    </p>
    <p>
    Next, start playing back a new stream with the same name as
    the one you're publishing but prefixed with "copy_".  What
    you should hear is just the audio, but transcoded to
    8KHZ stereo PCM raw audio.

    <p>
    Sometime a nice volunteer should make a pretty demo front
    end for this (hint.).
